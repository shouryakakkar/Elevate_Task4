Summary 
A firewall monitors network traffic and applies rules to allow or block connections based on criteria such as IP address, port number, and protocol.
Inbound rules control traffic coming into the device.
Outbound rules control traffic leaving the device.
Firewalls can be stateful (tracking active connections) or stateless (checking each packet individually).
In this example, the firewall was configured to deny TCP traffic on port 23 to block Telnet, then restore access.
